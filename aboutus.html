<h1>Meet The Team</h1>

<p>We are a team of passionate Computer Science students — Rebekah Robinson, Channing Barnes, Caleb Boyce, Izaiah Exum, and Bryce Benson — dedicated to using technology to solve real-world problems. As graduating seniors, we’ve combined our diverse skill sets in artificial intelligence, software development, and systems engineering to create ARGOS, an innovative drone-based inventory management solution.

ARGOS is designed to tackle challenges faced by the warehousing and logistics industries, providing real-time image analysis to detect and track objects. By automating inventory management, our solution reduces errors, minimizes operational costs, and enhances productivity. With a commitment to innovation and efficiency, we believe ARGOS has the potential to become an industry standard.

Through collaboration, creativity, and determination, we’ve brought this concept to life. As we prepare for the next step in our careers, we remain passionate about developing solutions that drive progress and make a meaningful impact.</p>
